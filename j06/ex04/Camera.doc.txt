<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Camera class handles camera.

The following values are expected by the constructor:

- origin: a Vertex representing the position of the camera
- orientation: a Matrix representing the orientation of the camera
- ratio: the quotient of the screen (width/height). (Note that you can
          either send the ratio argument, or both the width and height.)
- width and height: integer representing the size of the screen
- fov: the field of view in degrees
- near: the near clipping plan (int)
- far: the far clipping plan (int)

The following method is implemented for this class:

- watchVertex: This method require the vertex to be projected as argument
               and return the corresponding new vertex in the
               camera coordinate.
