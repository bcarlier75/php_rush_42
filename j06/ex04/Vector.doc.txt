<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vector.

An instance of a Vector can be contructed with an array containing the values:
- dest (instance of Vertex)
- orig (optionnal, instance of Vertex)

Verbose mode can be enabled with the static var Vertex::$verbose set to true.

The following methods are provided for this class:

Float getX();
Float getY();
Float getZ();
Float getW();

Float magnitude();
Returns the lenght of a vector.

Vector normalize();
Returns a normalized new instance of a Vector class.

Vector add( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the sum between current Vector and $rhs
in new instance of Vector class.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the substract between current Vector and $rhs
in new instance of Vector class.

Vector opposite()
Returns the opposite of the current Vector in new instance of Vector class.

Vector scalarProduct( $k )
Returns the result of the scalar product between current Vector
and the scalar $k in a new instance of Vector class.

Float dotProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the scalar product between current Vector
and the vector $rhs in a new instance of Vector class.

Float cos( Vector $rhs )
Returns the cosine; the angle between current Vector and the vector $rhs.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the cross product between current Vector
and the vector $rhs in new instance of Vector class.
